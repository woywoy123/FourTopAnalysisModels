d: DeltaR between pairs of children from a common top quark - Stack plot
e: The DeltaR between the four vector of the top quark and its children i.e. how much do the children deviate from the original top trajectory. - Stack Plot

a: Average number of Truth Jets / leptons in event

a: Average Number of Truth Jets produced from Top (excluding leptonic decays)
b: Average Number of Truth Jets formed from Top Children (excluding leptonic decays)
c: Number of leptons produced per event, and associated jets (expected but not reality (gluons...) W + b -> l + nu_l + b)


-> Figure 4: (x) Not Complete yet....
+Do as above but add deltaR between jet and truth jet 

-> Figure 5: (x) Not Complete yet....
+ Do Bruce Analysis.
+ Selection criteria:
~> Leptonic t: This is spectator 1
~> 2 Hardest b-tagged jets: these correspond to the Z' daughter tops
~> attach two other jets to each <somehow> (I use deltaR)
~> You now have the Z' -> ttbar daughters
~> Remaining jets are your 2nd spectators 
~> Form M(Z')
~> Fit fit M(Z') 

-> Modifications to Bruce's Proposal:
~> Jets have different levels of b-tagging (Working points) (85, 77, 70, 60, 0)
~> Match the emitted lepton to any jet nearby for all working points, regardless of PT hardness
~> Remove the added jet from jet collection 
~> Select two hardest jets (as before) but at different Working points. i.e. jj_{85, 77, 70, 60}_at_jl_{85, 77, 70, 60, 0}
